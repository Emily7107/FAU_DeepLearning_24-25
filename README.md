# FAU_DeepLearning_24-25

## Description
This repository contains completed exercises from the Deep Learning course offered by FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, taught by Professor Andreas Maier. We start with basic NumPy function practice, then implement fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks from scratch. Finally, we implement ResNet using PyTorch.
